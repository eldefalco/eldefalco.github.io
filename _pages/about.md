I am a fourth-year PhD student in Linguistics and Computational Linguistics at the [University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu) advised by [Richard Wright](https://linguistics.washington.edu/people/richard-wright) and [Gina-Anne Levow](https://linguistics.washington.edu/people/gina-anne-levow). My work integrates the study of speech technologies, affective science, and linguistics. I am currently focused on furthering our understanding of how emotion is expressed in speech through both multilingual corpus-based work and fieldwork with low-resource, endangered language communities. I employ qualitative and quantitative experimental and computational methodologies to analyze ethnopsychological and acoustic emotion data, with the aim of comparing the acoustic cues to emotion in speech across languages to examine the universality (or lack therof) of those cues.

Prior to joining UW in Fall 2022, I completed an MA in Language Documentation and Revitalization at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and a BA in Linguistics at the University of Rochester in upstate NY. My undergraduate and master's degrees focused on the documentation of speech in endangered languages and the cognitive aspects of linguistics. I will receive an MS in Computational Linguistics from UW in Spring 2026.

Outside of work, I love to travel, lift weights, weave, and try new things. I am a former Fulbrighter (English Teaching Assistant to Belgium 2018-2019) and Rotary Exchange Student (high school, the Netherlands, 2013-2014).
